# Introduction To Robotics

This repository includes a collection of homeworks and projects developed throughout the 'Introduction To Robotics' course taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest, each encompassing requirements, implementation instructions, code, and video/image files.

## Homework #2 - RGB

The first technical assignment of the semester was to light up an RGB LED by controlling each color with an individual potentiometer. This was realised using various electrical components (potentiometers, RGB LED, resistors, wires, breadboard), as well as the Arduino UNO microcontroller board. Using the Arduino IDE (and the code uploaded in the Homework2_RGB folder), I read the values from the potentiometers and assigned them to their respective LED in order to add colors gradually to the RGB LED.

## Homework #3 - Elevator Simulation

The purpose of this task was to simulate the movement of an elevator between three floors. This was realised using a breadboard, three red LEDs to illustrate the floor on which the elevator is at, three pushbuttons used to "call" the elevator to a certain floor, a blue LED to indicate the movement of the elevator between floors and a passive buzzer which generates a simple tone of 800Hz when the doors of the elevator would close and a short one of 1000Hz when it "arrives" at its destination. The initial state of the elevator is on the first floor. To run the simulation, I used the Arduino UNO microcontroller board and the Arduino IDE (with the code uploaded in the Homework3_Elevator folder). The electrical scheme and physical setup are presented below:

## Homework #4 - 7 Segment Display Drawing

This task involves drawing on a Seven Segment Display by using a joystick to navigate through the segments and light them up at will. In order to achieve this, I used the Arduino UNO microcontroller board, a breadboard, a 7 Segment Display, 220Î© resistors and wires as needed, as well as a joystick. The movement between segments is indicated in a given matrix (as shown below), and the simulation code (which is uploaded in the Homework4_7Segment folder) is run using the Arduino IDE.

The starting position is on the decimal point segment, and the current segment is indicated through a blinking of its led. The joystick can also be used to reset the display segments to their initial state in order to begin drawing from the top.

## Homework #5 - Stopwatch 

This technical assignment consists of simulating a stopwatch using a Four Digit Seven Segment Display and the 74HC595 Shift Register (as well as other electrical components such as buttons, resistors, wires, breadboards and the Arduino UNO microcontroller board). This project has multiple functionalities, such as using a button to start or pause the stopwatch, one to memorise up to four laps and another button to reset the timer back to its initial state (000.0). The lap button can also be used to view the previously recorded laps. In developing this project, I also learned about multiplexing and making use of optical persistence when working with multiple LEDs.
The adjacent code can be found in the Homework5_Stopwatch folder.

## Homework #6 - Environment Monitor and Loggger

This following projects is based on working with sensors, the serial monitor and RGB LED to monitor the light in the environment, to measure distances, offer feedback and log data. On the hardware side, I worked with the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, the Light-Dependent Resistor, one RGB LED, the Arduino UNO board and other basic electrical components such as wires, resistors and a breadboard. On the coding side, I used the Arduino IDE and learned to work with EEPROM, as well as the flash memory (adjacent code in the Homework6_EnvironmentMonitor).
To access all the functionalities of the Monitor and Logger, the user interacts through a menu within the serial monitor. The menu has four main options, each with more detailed functionalities:

1. **Sensor Settings**: in here, the user can choose a sampling interval between 1 and 10 seconds to tell the system how often to collect data from the sensors; the user can also set a treshold for each sensor, establishing the smallest value they can retrieve from the environment before throwing an error.
2. **Reset Logger Data**: this option gives the opportunity of deleting the existing measurements and restarting from 0.
3. **System Status**: this third option is for checking the data that's being collected; in here, the user can see what the system is recording in real time, the last 10 measurements saved and the settings set for the sensors (either default or what was set at 1.)
4. **RGB LED Control**: finally, this slot is for controlling the colours the RGB LED uses to give feedback; the user is presented with two modes:
   - automatic, where by default green inidicates if the system is functioning within given parameters and red indicates that the recorded values are exceeding the tresholds 
   - manual, where the user can choose their own colour code for feedback.
